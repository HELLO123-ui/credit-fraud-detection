            <h2>What is Credit Card Fraud Detection?</h2>
            <p>
                Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying unauthorized or suspicious transactions on a credit card. 
                Using machine learning models trained on historical data, we can predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
